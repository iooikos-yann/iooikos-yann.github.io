ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE – THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY – OUTRO
Posted on May 11, 2018 by Yann Tromeur

This new industry, this new tool, this new work force is emerging with the speed of a rocket reaching for Mars.

We can judge from this week’s Google I/O event, that AI clearly becoming a priority for the GAFA (especially with the expansion of mobile devices) and it is already in an advanced stage.

Google demonstrated a virtual assistant able to take an appointment through a phone conversation. Baffling. Astonishing.

We are living in a world where AI / robots technology is going to assist / replace humans. It is a fact.

As mentioned by Matthew Hutson | Science magazine in “Has artificial intelligence become alchemy?”, the issue is not anymore “When we are going to use it” but “How we want to develop it”.

Google’s AI phone call, does not look like Alchemy to me. It is a well conceived machine. It is 21st century Engineering.

AI will revolutionized our lives socially, economically, environmentally the way the Internet did twenty years ago.

AI could violently disrupt our society. And like any technologies, we need dogmas, controls, rules and laws.

Our governments are again unprepared and let or fund, for the moment, private companies free of developing AI.

After all, it is considered “only” computing. We ought to act and prepare soon new laws for controlling AI expansion.

I hope Asimov’s Law will at least be applied.

Asimov’s Three Laws, quoted as being from the “Handbook of Robotics, 56th Edition, 2058 A.D.”, are:

A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws

Those basic laws must be taught and improved.

More than a technology, humanity is birthing a new form of life.

This “Being” will be able to interact with the world (or beyond) in various ways. AI will be present simultaneously in any part of the world, view and hear things, eventually comment on events. AI can interact with animals (you know us) and machines around the world in a “heartbit”.

Our privacy and our activities are being processed by programs. More than ever, we must enforce controls on technology.

We cannot trust private corporations to keep our data a secret for ever. AI is touching deeper our need for privacy control, as AI will assist you on various task it will not always, for practical reasons, ask your permission. It will assist you the way you chose it.

So mistakes can be made. And they will. “Sh\*\*t happens” says the sticker on the cars.

In a world where humans sometimes feel like machines, can machines think they are humans? As a species, we already went through tremendous evolution.

From caves to the Moon, from industrial revolutions to global economy, from world wars to peace, but can we sustain? At the moment Doomsday clock shows 2 minutes before midnight.

AI will bring issues, if not controlled chaos, but will help as well climbing other steps at speed no other civilization was able to achieve.

More than ever, we just need to show Control, Ethic, Wisdom and humbleness to what is to come.
