I"Ä<p>Last night, I stumbled on this‚ÄØvery simple hands on introduction to LAMBDA:</p>

<p>https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/serverless-web-app/</p>

<p>A short hour tutorial, to refresh my mind on what‚Äôs up at the moment and forgetting about the old fashion (yes) way: server, datastorage, hypervisor and Virtual machines before installing the services developers need.</p>

<p>I am not particularly into developing at the moment, been one a looong time ago. Fifteen years I definitely joined the obscure side of IT, network / server administrator, never to come back.</p>

<p>That old fashion way is being gently erased progressively and I guess we are in for a treat.</p>

<p>(Because)</p>

<p>Things are going to change‚Ä¶ faster than you think</p>

<p>You know virtualization, cloud systems? Those disrupted (gigantically) our job as network administrator. But developer / services providers still need a couple of guys handling things for them. Installing hardware, systems, managing them‚Ä¶etc.</p>

<p>Like petrol, this is all soon gone and replaced for the good of humanity (IT people) by a better source.</p>

<p>I do not like this terminology ‚ÄúServerless‚Äù, unless mistaken, we still stack countless buildings with servers, switches, firewalls and cables. But, I guess, we are to reduce this amount of energy needed with micro services running on larger servers and Amazon and Google look to promise 100% renewable energy for their clouds, aren‚Äôt they?</p>

<p>As mentioned above, I gave it a go and finding that Serverless will disrupt all administrator things again, made me smile again hoping for a sustainability and smartness for IT.</p>

<p>So what is it exactly?</p>

<p>Dear Wiki, thank you : Serverless computing‚ÄØis a‚ÄØcloud computing‚ÄØexecution model‚ÄØin which the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application, rather than on pre-purchased units of capacity.[1]‚ÄØIt is a form of‚ÄØutility computing.</p>

<p>Dear Forbes, thank you even more for this one line definition:</p>

<p>Serverless Computing has the least number of buttons to push, knobs to turn, and sliders to drag.</p>

<p>I guess that makes it pretty clear no? Serverless is effortless, puts more time to yourself for creativity. Developers won‚Äôt be cranky anymore, Administrators will be useless‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Unless‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Wait, does it not mean brainless?</p>

<p>Again, whatever machine / system / organism : evolution is needed or death will be the outcome.</p>

<p>So, my dear fellow admins please if not there yet, start training. Cloud meant no in-house servers, not no IT service. We are still needed, until A.I. comes for us ahahah!</p>

<p>Serverless means (almost) no Operating systems hassle / BS. Yes, stick it on your desk: it‚Äôs already here!</p>

<p>? Need a database service: well just ask for the service to be setup (NEXT NEXT NEXT), and your database is available in a couple of minutes.</p>

<p>? Need Authentication, well what do you prefer: Facebook, Google, Amazon, email, phone number? Just check the box.</p>

<p>? Monitoring your app: do yourself a favour and select that log option !</p>

<p>I guess I will need to write another another article for this to be more technical!</p>

<p>No more hardware to purchase, no more OS setup, no patching needed, no hassle, just the service!</p>

<p>It is not a surprise, our favorite cloud providers (AWS, GCP, AZURE) love us: they want us to have more free time‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Joke aside, we have to get ourselves ready. Challenges are on the way. We need to change our mindset, become services architects, complex hybrid cloud security experts!</p>

<p>Those tools are great, but centralized / hybrid dashboards and management tools still need to be provided.</p>

<p>You remember when Windows delivered Powershell: we believed we would become ‚ÄúSystems Programmers‚Äù. Well I still don‚Äôt see much of my colleagues as programmers yet.</p>

<p>This is our New Game</p>

<p>This disruption will let us focalize our attention on users (you know the others) as time-consuming resources management tasks will gently fade away.</p>

<p>More, web services / mobile apps will become more scalable and faster as well as less depending on such System provider as all of them will basically use or provide serverless standards.</p>

<p>Then, the greatest advantage is to finally see our dear schemas and API flow schemas come to life, with almost no difference from concept to production.</p>

<p>So, here we are welcome to that new tech, you were hoping to change the world‚Ä¶ Well at least for us mere IT people.</p>

<p>What will be our next smart evolution ?</p>
