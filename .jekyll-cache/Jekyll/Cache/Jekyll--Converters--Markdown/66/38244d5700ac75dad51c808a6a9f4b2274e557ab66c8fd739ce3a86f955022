<p>Part 3 of serverless article, fascinating new approach to computed business processes services</p>

<p>Wait, does it not mean brainless?</p>

<p>Again, whatever machine / system / organism : evolution is needed or death will be the outcome.</p>

<p>So, my dear fellow admins please if not there yet, start training. Cloud meant no in-house servers, not no IT service. We are still needed, <a href="http://www.iooikos.com/single-post/2018/03/24/The-Mother-of-all-Disruptions-aka-where-is-IT-going-now">until A.I. comes for us</a> ahahah!</p>

<p>Serverless means (almost) no Operating systems hassle / BS.</p>

<p>Yes, stick it on your desk: it’s already here!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Need a database service: well just ask for the service to be setup (NEXT NEXT NEXT), and your database is available in a couple of minutes.</li>
  <li>Need Authentication, well what do you prefer: Facebook, Google, Amazon, email, phone number? Just check the box.</li>
  <li>Monitoring your app: do yourself a favor and select that log option !</li>
</ul>

<p>I guess I will need to write another another article for this to be more technical!</p>

<p>No more hardware to purchase, no more OS setup, no patching needed, no hassle, just the service!</p>

<p>It is not a surprise, our favorite cloud providers (AWS, GCP, AZURE) love us: they want us to have more free time…</p>

<p>Joke aside, we have to get ourselves ready. Challenges are on the way. We need to change our mindset, become services architects, complex hybrid cloud security experts!</p>

<p>Those tools are great, but centralized / hybrid dashboards and management tools still need to be provided.</p>

<p>Remember when Windows delivered Powershell: we believed we would become “Systems Programmers”. Well I still don’t see much of my colleagues as programmers yet.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6b985f_8c2f0c82fce640b4a3ec1f9a9aebe1de~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_484,h_319,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/6b985f_8c2f0c82fce640b4a3ec1f9a9aebe1de~mv2.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is our New Game</p>

<p>… for the moment</p>

<p>This disruption will help us to focus more our attention on users (you know the others) as time-consuming resources management tasks will gently fade away.</p>

<p>More, web services / mobile apps will become more scalable and faster as well as less depending on such System provider as all of them will basically use or provide serverless standards.</p>

<p>Then, the greatest advantage is to finally see our dear schemas and API flow schemas come to life, with almost no difference from conception to production.</p>

<p>So, here we are welcome to that new tech, you were hoping to change the world… Well at least for us mere IT people.</p>

<p>What will be our next smart (r)evolution?</p>

<p>Real serverless I guess, services empowered by all communicating IoT devices, sharing resources in a smart and secure way.</p>

<p>Cloud Services will be mobile and widely redundant in their next distributed form.</p>

<p>Distributed services will offer better security and redundancy, improving reliability and avoid services unavailability, since physical datacenters will be unnecessary.</p>

<p>This disruption will also have to be supported by you, my fellow IT guys, embrace it as you would for any forthcoming smart revolution.</p>
