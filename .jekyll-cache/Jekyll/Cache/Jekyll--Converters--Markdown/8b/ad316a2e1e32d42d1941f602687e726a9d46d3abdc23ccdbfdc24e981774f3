<p>===============================================</p>

<p>Posted on <a href="https://iooikos.co/blog-post/project-delivery-can-your-customers-trust-you-2/">January 23, 2018</a> by <a href="https://iooikos.co/author/gmailyatr/">Yann Tromeur</a></p>

<p>Today I was on both of the fence.</p>

<p>I recently ordered a new high speed internet for home and still expect my provider to deliver the service… “it can take up to 5 days”, did not mentioned it when I signed the order… As a customer, I am deeply frustrated and a little angry…</p>

<p>High speed internet is like water and electricity now. Family survival depends on it (sic). Problem for my provider, I know the drill. Either scheduling was wrong, technician not sufficiently competent or bad luck, cabling not good.</p>

<p>I know the drill, I assist my customers when they need internet delivery when moving to new locations. I know the drill too well…</p>

<p>Today, I also received a long complaint from a customer.</p>

<p>Basically feeling misinformed and trying to get explanation of why we had to postpone his project with such a short notice. “I have customers I can’t fail” he mentionned. I know this drill as well.</p>

<p>Project Delivery is my job. Failing my customers is not in my vocabulary, neither for my colleagues. I am here as well to coordinate providers with our project team on projects specified by our sales team based on our customers requirements.</p>

<p>Tons of things can go wrong during a project. Only things that save us : experience and trust!</p>

<p>Though I could understand the technical service on the other line at my internet provider, unable to provide me answer as when or why or how I will get the internet back, my Delivery Manager 6th sense was saying : “they failed to provide, they have to deliver”.</p>

<p>I deeply think a company has the customers it deserves. You have to build trust with customers before they can accept for you to fail sometimes.</p>

<p>After a couple of emails to the complaining customers, statu quo: “we will get back to you with information you expect”.</p>

<p>Only difference between my internet provider and me: first thing tomorrow, I will shake my colleagues about this and get the information before I leave the office.</p>

<p>A word is a word, but when given you better keep up with the trust of our customers.</p>

<p>It is just a job after all, but at the end of the day who can you trust when you want your project to be well delivered?</p>

<p>Don’t lie or hide information, be as much prepared and precise as you can when you start your projects: trust between you and your customer will help you go through hardest failures.</p>
