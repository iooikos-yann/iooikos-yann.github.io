<p>In this new regular series, I will give you my best investments, tips, tricks that gave me the best results to achieve goals. If you thought I was goingÂ to give you away the latest cryptocurrency whale (maybe next time) or some Wall Street type advice, wellâ€¦</p>

<p>Sorry to disappoint you ! (not, actually, eheh)</p>

<p>Number one: Guitar Lessons</p>

<p>For the past ten years, I have been taking guitar courses at the same school (<a href="http://www.youmusic.lu/">Rock University</a>). The School Learning though mostly based on learning through practive is very solid, with a beautiful of passionate teachers. Kids, Adults, absolute beginners and future stars:Â everyone is welcome.</p>

<p>First benefit: this gives me a regular activity outside of my work and life / life. As any routine, this gives you some rule to stick to.</p>

<p>Second Benefit: gave me an extra push in Discipline, since you have to goÂ every week.Â The service is not only learning to play an instrument or a song !</p>

<p>Third Benefit: MEET PEOPLE. All sorts of people, from all ages, you might make friends (as I did) and customers (as well). If you are a serial introvert, the two students â€“ one teacher lesson is a must! Very different from standing in front of screenâ€¦</p>

<p>Fourth Benefit: practicing an instrument will give youÂ patienceÂ (you will need some at first) andÂ persistance. IfÂ any professionalÂ  activity would benefit of this,Â managementÂ is surely in the list.</p>

<p>Overall, what I meanÂ is : quit your daily traffic / work / traffic routing for a few hours every week to sustain a regular social activity. Basic but true: step outside from your habits !</p>

<p>Estimated return on investment : 150 % in 3 years. Especially if you become a guitar hero on the way! At least you feel you are!</p>

<p>Number Two: Calm</p>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/calm/id571800810?l=fr&amp;mt=8">Calm</a>Â is a mindfulness meditation app. It costs 35 â‚¬ per year and really gives you a boost (not sure this is the right expression in this case, hum).</p>

<p>I have been practicing Mindful Meditation since late 2016. Learned about it through books, did a couple of training at schools and then practice it.</p>

<p>After a couple of weeks,I was quite irregular on the practice. Benefits were low.</p>

<p>So, discovering Calm really changed my mindful game ! (I feel I sound like an infomercial now!). Some of you might not find meditation as a suitable activity: you need to stand still and concentrate for a few minutes.</p>

<p>It was very difficult for me at first to reach that focus. Practice is the key.Â Running helps me to liberate energy. Mindful Meditation to control and use it.</p>

<p>First Benefit: Calm is like Strava or Runtastic. You make your goals, and the app helps you to stick to them. You get kudos on your streaks.Â Very motivating.</p>

<p>Second Benefit: meditation sessions are organised in themes. You even have 7 days or 21 days sessions on the themes you want to improve:Â stress, sleep, focusâ€¦</p>

<p>Third Benefit:Â soothes you. Before you begin your day or at the end of the day or both, find your spot and launch the app. I recommand the usage of phones to enter the mindfulÂ world of Calm.</p>

<p>Fourth Benefit: so you want to do meditation, you want to try ? Calm is asÂ good forÂ  the mindful rookiesÂ as it is for the more experienced ones.</p>

<p>After a few months of daily usage (10 to 30 minutes sessions), the results were very impressive: I really appreciate my meditation sessions. And love the smartÂ challenge to improve my streaks and reach new goals.</p>

<p>Estimated return on investment : 300 % within aÂ year. Very low price for what it gives. Very professional and coversÂ lots of topics. Will help you on your challenges.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed my little tips and tricks of the day! Please do not hesitate to post comments or share your own. Have a nice week!</p>
