<p>Goalsâ€¦ DX is not other different than any transformation / change / creation you wish to apply to a structure or a business.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/acb9f725af414b4eb30473b5b8ecfe74.jpg/v1/fill/w_484,h_323,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/acb9f725af414b4eb30473b5b8ecfe74.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first question to ask : what is (are) your Goal (s) ? What do you want to achieve ?</p>

<p>In a recentÂ <a href="https://idc-community.com/groups/it_agenda/it-governance/goals_strategic_priorities_and_bold_bets_for_digital_transformation_~1">study</a>, IDC mentioned companies where looking towards three main goals:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Improve Customer Experience</li>
  <li>Improve Competitiveness</li>
  <li>Create New Models</li>
</ol>

<p>On the long term, you need to sustain a smart and cohesive direction, so you absolutely need to knowâ€¦</p>

<p>WHY do you do it for?</p>

<p>The first questions when starting a new project is always shaping the restÂ of the work.</p>

<p>In DX projects, the WHY is definitely the most important, if not the only questions to ask your customers / your organisation.</p>

<p>The WHY is a catalystÂ for successÂ : it gives a goal to project the organisationÂ to. The path to a successful DXÂ needs you toÂ be mindful about the destination. As the obstacles along the way can be many, the DX team will have to be prepared to remove them as they come along. Thus a good acknowledged WHY will help leverage the â€œrocksâ€Â and strengthen the team when encountering a â€œbumpâ€.</p>

<p>In short, the first step of describing your GOAL of a DX move is toÂ agree WHYÂ your business / organisation wants to move towards this direction.</p>

<p>WHY must be clearly defined for everyone (not only first level and second level management) : the whole organisation is concerned!</p>

<p>I canâ€™t stress enough the importance of those first steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Win theÂ agreementÂ and understanding of the majority</li>
  <li>InsureÂ individual objectivesÂ are clearly defined and followed</li>
</ol>

<p>As much as it is rare to encounter someone with a clear vision, uprising the WHY throughÂ aÂ collective effortÂ will increase the chances of success. Crucial !</p>

<p><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f69f0ddab5a5bff3e4d39520e1632772.jpg/v1/fill/w_484,h_323,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/f69f0ddab5a5bff3e4d39520e1632772.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>Also, to avoid at all cost: taking inspiration from your existing goals.Â DX is aboutÂ bringing out innovation!Â Donâ€™t try recycling your old IT plansâ€¦ They wonâ€™t work as there is a good chance part of the team already knows about them. Donâ€™t be a fool, being an innovative collective will give you an extra push!</p>

<p>TODO: have your mind set on the WHY! be sure (ask yourself and the team twice) ! Write them down, diffuse them and stick to them!</p>

<p>What kind of achievements do you expect?</p>

<p>Got your mind set on why ? Second step follows, define your objectivesÂ : expected improvements.</p>

<p>Now you know WHY you are doing a move to DX, you need to define your expected achievements.</p>

<p>As you might already notice, the technical aspect of DX is out of scope for the moment. The sub decision making process can be long, but do not be alarm on the time and efforts spent on starting the journey : you need toÂ be generous on your dedication to define theÂ scope.</p>

<p>As you will move on to the path to DX, every hour spent before defining your GOALS will save you days of struggle on your project.</p>

<p>Improve your processes</p>

<p>AtÂ the rootÂ of your project, DX will impact your processes.Â Simply because beforehand, the project definition will make youÂ changeÂ your existing processes. DX is traversal, change will occur inside butÂ also outsideÂ your business. As you move alongÂ the project, your clients and your providers will participate and benefit to the effort.</p>

<p>Shift your organisation</p>

<p>Inside, you can expect faster and more collaborative organisation.Â Communication improvedÂ between people and systems, will bring a smoother collaborative environment. AutomatedÂ smart tools bringing out faster and more accurate information will bring solid ground for your daily business decisions.</p>

<p>Build better Customer relationships</p>

<p>As you would build smarter and closer to user systems, customers will benefit directly, experiencing customized, smart and fast services.Â DX will insure a long term and qualitative relationship with your brand. Easier payments, less complaints are guaranteed.</p>

<p>â€¦Â Achievements can have multiple form, I brought youÂ a few examples of what DX can do. You will you own !</p>

<p>To wrap this up. Let me stress again :</p>
