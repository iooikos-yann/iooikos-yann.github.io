<p>Or shall I say SolutionSÂ Provider ?</p>

<p>First, keep calm.</p>

<p>Being stressed and moving all over the place can get you things done, but the moment you think you closed it, well, you can suffer many drawbacks from this behavior:</p>

<ol>
  <li>No lessons learned: when you get rid of things fast, might work for a moment but are you sure that you fixed the root cause of your problem. =&gt;Â think documenting / improvement</li>
  <li>Exhaustion: well how long can you perform at 120 mph? Do you know how your colleagues / employees feel about it. =&gt; think long term / strategy</li>
  <li>Did you kill the beast?Â : are you a hundred percent sure this is a bullâ€™s eye shot you took? An identical issue / a spawned problem might re-emerge. =&gt; (re) evaluate your solution</li>
</ol>

<p>That is when tools come in usefulâ€¦</p>

<p>Second, please review the three steps closely with a fresh mind.</p>

<p>Storm is passed, problem is solved. Now what? Letâ€™s elevate the issue and avoid any unforeseen consequence or, worse, a reiteration:</p>

<p>ent yourself from exhaustion.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Think documentingÂ and what improvement the team could make to avoid any similar issue. Post mortem review: write things down communication to team involved. Always think documenting (use standards) and reviewing, a meeting can be useful as well, even a short unformal one.</li>
  <li>The goal is to succeed, it is not a speed race: you might need time for this to happen. Always think long term and strategy, you need to be alert and ready, stay calm and meditate (yes DO THAT) to prev</li>
</ol>

<p>We often struggle facing issues in our daily work, those can be big or small challenges, urgent or not, critical or basic. Overcoming those issues, resolving those problems can be a tremendous task, both exhausting and time consuming.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Once you have kept your cool and write things down,Â goÂ back to the crime sceneÂ and CSI the corpse: is it really dead? Did my silver bullet really killed the monster? Review the solution and its forthcoming events : improvements, re-organizationâ€¦ in short any necessary changes; and once you have done : put a second bullet and kill it again.Â MAKE SURE THE ISSUE IS GONE FOR GOOD.</li>
</ol>

<p>In short : DOCUMENT, REVIEW, DOUBLE CHECK.</p>

<p>This tip comes from several readings I made in the past years. Obvious but I need to write it down to emphasize what is not the most obvious for the most of us: discipline yourself and stick to it.</p>

<p>For this short method, I used two main sources for this short problem solving.</p>

<p>Ray Dalio â€˜s</p>

<p><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6b985f_afc478869125425184287235a8877f71~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_550,h_391,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/6b985f_afc478869125425184287235a8877f71~mv2.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ray Dalio is a famous investor who published is work principles last year. If not already, you should buy this interesting book:Â <a href="https://www.principles.com/">https://www.principles.com/</a></p>

<p>I just wanted to share with you this 5-steps method for problem solving, consisting of iterations and very similar to coding, like doing small steps to debug. In fact, Dalio calls the system he works on its â€œmachinesâ€.</p>

<p>So itâ€™s fairly easy:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Have a veryÂ clear goal.</li>
  <li>Identify andÂ donâ€™t tolerate the problemsÂ that stand in the way.</li>
  <li>DiagnoseÂ the problems look for their origins.</li>
  <li>Design plansÂ to get around the root cause of the problems you diagnosed. IfÂ any new problem arise, go back to 3.</li>
  <li>Apply and do the designsÂ as foreseen.</li>
</ol>

<p>And voilÃ  ! problem solved. Ray Dalioâ€™s method can be calledÂ  almost perfect and is quite complete. Training is definitely needed, and also needs time to follow.</p>

<p>Flip it !</p>

<p>No, this is not a method to make better pancakes or omelettes !</p>

<p>Three steps from problem solving:</p>

<ol>
  <li>identifyÂ and define the issue</li>
  <li>defineÂ your solution again and again until it looks perfect</li>
  <li>transformÂ it to a greater good</li>
</ol>

<p>So basically, that is it.</p>

<p>The trickiest part for the one is the iteration when the actual flipping occurs. This is a very good method for teamwork oriented solution and definitely a must in meeting or for AGILE organisations.</p>

<p>I guess everyone haveÂ their ownÂ best tricks for problem solving. I hope mine will guide you along the way when needed.Â Make them yours !</p>
