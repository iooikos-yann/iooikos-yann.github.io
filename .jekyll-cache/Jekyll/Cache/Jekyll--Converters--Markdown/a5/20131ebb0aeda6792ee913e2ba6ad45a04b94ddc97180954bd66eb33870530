<p>an open letter to my dear IT admins Colleagues</p>

<p>By any means this article not endorsed by AMAZON Web Services, GOOGLE Cloud Platform or MICROSOFT Azure (but we wish).</p>

<p>Last night, I (gracefully) stumbled on this very simple hands-on introduction to LAMBDA:</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/serverless-web-app/">https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/serverless-web-app/</a></p>

<p>A short hour tutorial, to refresh my mind on what’s up at the moment and forgetting about the old fashion (yes) way: server, storage, hypervisor and Virtual machines before installing the services developers need.</p>

<p>Using the fictitious company Wild Rydes (better than contoso Ha!…), you will setup a web app allowing to dispatch Unicorns “à-la” Uber to your location.</p>

<p>My two-year old daughter was screaming with joy seeing the web page:</p>

<p>We are in for a treat…</p>

<p>I am not particularly into developing at the moment, I have been a Notes specialist a looong time ago I also develop small Microsoft Access database / Applications and did some C# / Web App as well as Microsoft SAL management. It has been Fifteen years since I definitely joined the obscure side of IT, network / server administrator, never to come back.</p>

<p>But this is not a career article! Let’s go back to my last night AWS experience.</p>

<p>I found particular joy in following rather clear explanations of this tutorial. Amazon is really good for communication, I also browsed more on their website on the side and well, they DO deliver guidance.</p>

<p>Amazon describes in five steps, using their cloud micro service solution, what you can do and use once you develop a smart website. The range covered are website repository (S3), user authentication and management (COGNITO), backend (LAMBDA / DYNAMODB) and API (API GATEWAY) setup are described and easily setup with easy steps.</p>

<p><strong>Develop a smart website…</strong></p>

<p><strong>So if you are a server administrator, curious or providing support to a bunch of developers / database masters, this would basically explain you what your next tool is.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I would also recommend similar tech / tutorial so you are sure you checked all mainstream providers:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Google Cloud Platform :</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://medium.com/google-cloud/deploying-a-serverless-env-in-minutes-with-gcp-22008c42dfa4">https://medium.com/google-cloud/deploying-a-serverless-env-in-minutes-with-gcp-22008c42dfa4</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>MICROSOFT AZURE :</strong></p>

<p><strong>h<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/videos/get-started-with-azure-functions/">ttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/videos/get-started-with-azure-functions/</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Those are not as fancy as dispatching ‘Uber’nicorns, but hey you have to be serious sometimes!</strong></p>

<p><strong>YES, that old fashion way is being (gently) erased progressively and I guess we are in for a treat.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Now, just bow in awe in presence of your new God / Master / Paradigm.</strong></p>

<p><strong>(Because)</strong></p>
