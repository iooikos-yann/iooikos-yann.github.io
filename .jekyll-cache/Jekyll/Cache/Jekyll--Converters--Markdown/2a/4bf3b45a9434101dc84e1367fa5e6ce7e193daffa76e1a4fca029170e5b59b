<p>In this new section, I am not going to talk about myself or any of my work / self-improvement / techno obsession (just a little).</p>

<p>Here is week four â€œWEDNESDAYâ€™S STRANGERâ€.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ca7884cac5d6400499f7c06500710ef5.png/v1/fill/w_385,h_385,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/ca7884cac5d6400499f7c06500710ef5.webp" alt="" /></p>

<p>Every Wednesday on the iooikosÂ blog, I will talk about a personality. Someone you might know, but most of the time no. Because I like surprises, I will try to surprise you every week and treat you with discovering a personality, a character I found interesting, that struck me during the week, in the past year, someone I might know personally as wellâ€¦ or not !</p>

<p>So, without further adoâ€¦</p>

<p>About ten days ago, Mamoudou Gassama, a 22 year-old Malian,Â saved a kid dangling over a balcony. This brave man made the headlines around the world for his courage.</p>

<p>The savior is an illegal immigrant and he was almost imme-diately given French Citizen for his oustanding behaviour.Â Highly deserved right!</p>

<p>In a world where immigrants are rejected and people seem to care less and less about each other, this kind of moment gives us hope for the future.</p>

<p>ButÂ Mamoudou Gassama is not my stranger of the week. Too obviousâ€¦</p>

<p>Neither is, for negative reasons, the father of the â€œBalcony Kidâ€. This guy represents a lost generation, too occupied by its always-on mobile screen, unable to achieve awareness of the surrounding world. Most of them seem to prefer to live through a simulation. And TV was thought bad for kidsâ€¦ Well Pokemon GO is worst !</p>

<p>So no, that guy, whose name remains secret, will confront a judge soon. He might be condemned to two years in Prison. In that case, the system works.</p>

<p>But in the case of my stranger of the week, the system / the french state did not apply.</p>

<p>Aymen Latrous is a Tunisian. As you might have guessed he is also an illegal.</p>

<p>Aymen Latrous save two kids from a burning house. A baby and his older brother saved.</p>

<p>Same story, but not the same ending.</p>

<p>Aymen Latrous is on the verge of being deported back to his country.</p>

<p>But because no one filmed his act, because there was not twitter / facebook / instagram to diffuse the act, no one knows about him.</p>

<p>I hope French Gouvernment will apply the same right toÂ Aymen Latrous as they did toÂ Mamoudou Gassama. But sometimes our society can be so biased, because like the dangling kidâ€™s father we only care about what we see in our phone.</p>
